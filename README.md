# Welcome to my coding space! 

My name is Phillip Neibaur, but you can call me Phil! I'm a software developer 
currently enrolled in General Assembly coding bootcamp for fullstack development!

## I plan to expand my skills 

As I learn more about the software engineering field, I have "discovered my people" so to speak. 
I come from a background in psychology with a focus on relational-treatment. My focus for much of my life 
has been around people, seeing their needs, and helping them in the best way they need. 

- I discoverd I loved managing systems on the backend and making them smoother!
- I particularly loved working to find and display importat data to the right people. 
- As I have developed my skills as a programmer, I also have discovered I enjoy front-end development. 
- I have particular goals to learn: 
    - SQL and data analytics
    - React

In short, I feel my life experience lends me to cater my skills on the needs of my future clients.
